### 3. Managing Resources

- Use the **Add** dropdown to add resources to the asset bundle.
- Click **Schedule** on a notebook within the asset bundle to create a **job definition** that schedules the notebook.

## Documentation

- For information on using **Databricks Asset Bundles in the workspace**, see: [Databricks Asset Bundles in the workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/workspace-bundles)
- For details on the **Databricks Asset Bundles format** used in this asset bundle, see: [Databricks Asset Bundles Configuration reference](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/reference)

## Testing

Run tests against Databricks (default):

```bash
uv run pytest --compute=databricks
```

Run tests locally (requires PySpark + Delta support installed):

```bash
uv run pytest --compute=local
```

You can also set `TEST_COMPUTE=databricks|local` to control the default mode.

### Delta tables in local tests

Local-mode tests use a local Spark session configured with Delta Lake extensions so you can create/write/read Delta tables during tests (via `delta-spark`).

For more detail (compute selection, markers, fixture loading, and Delta setup), see `good_practices/testing.md`.
